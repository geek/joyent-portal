# Commit Guidelines

```
<type><(scope)?>: <msg>
```

Where type is one of:

```
build
chore
ci
docs
feat
fix
perf
refactor
revert
style
test
```

And where scope is one of ui-toolkit, my-joy-beta, cloudapi-gql, boilerplate, and create-instance.

_The recommended method to commit should be by running npm run commit._
